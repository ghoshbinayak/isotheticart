Being a novice in the area of research, this project would not have been possible without constant
supervision of Prof. Arindam Biswas. The combinatorial algorithm for construction of isothetic cover of digital objects, developed by Prof. Arindam Biswas and his colleagues, formed the basis of our project. Also, the works of Mike Bostock in the field of algorithmic visualisation have served as great source for inspiration.\\

\begin{abstract}
This report summarizes the work done as part of a semester project under the supervision of Prof. Arindam Biswas. The project explores the fascinating field of generative art. Using random isothetic polygons interesting visually stimulating patterns have been generated from existing images. These patterns are shown in the report and the processes used to generate them have been discussed.

\section{INTRODUCTION}
Algorithmic art or generative art refers to art (mainly visual art) that in whole or in part has been created with the use of an autonomous system. In such an art form the generative system is said to be the creation of the artist which in turn creates a set of images which are unique and visually appealing.  
So generation of patterns a system needs to be created which on being provided some form of input will produce a set of images.

\vspace{0.3cm} 
Isothetic polygons can be used to generate isothetic covers of binary images which can then be divided into unit gird blocks. These blocks can then be filled with different colors based on some algorithms to produce visually appealing patterned images. Thus using isothetic polygons a generation system can be created which can produce some random patterns based on binary images of regular day to day objects/shapes.

\section{PRELIMINARIES AND DEFINITIONS}


\textit{Digital Plane}: The digital plane,$\textbf{Z}^2$,is the set of all points having 
integer coordinates in the real plane $\textbf{R}^2$ .A point in the digital plane is 
called a digital point,or called a pixel in case of a digital image.Henceforth,the term
"point" and "digital point" will be interchangeably used.
\break


\textit{Digital grid}: A grid \textbf{G} := (\textbf{H},\textbf{V}) consists of a set \textbf{H} of horizontal grid lines and a set \textbf{V} of vertical grid lines, where, \textbf{H} = \{...,${\textit{l}}_H$(\textit{j-2g}),${\textit{l}}_H$(\textit{j-g}), ${\textit{l}}_H$(\textit{j}), ${\textit{l}}_H$(\textit{j+g}), ${\textit{l}}_H$(\textit{j+2g}),...\}{$\subset $$\textbf{Z}^2$} and \textbf{V}=\{...,${\textit{l}}_V$(\textit{j-2g}),${\textit{l}}_V$(\textit{j-g}), ${\textit{l}}_V$(\textit{j}), ${\textit{l}}_V$(\textit{j+g}), ${\textit{l}}_V$(\textit{j+2g}),...\}{$\subset $$\textbf{Z}^2$}, for a grid size,\textit{g} $\in$ {$\textbf{Z}^+$}. Here, ${\textit{l}}_H$ := \{(\textit{ $\i^{'}$},\textit{j}):\textit{$\i^{'}$}$\in$ \textbf{Z} denotes the horizontal grid line and ${\textit{l}}_V$ := \{(\textit{i},\textit{ $\j^{'}$}):\textit{$\j^{'}$}$\in$ \textbf{Z} denotes the vertical grid line intersecting at point (\textit{i},\textit{j})$\in$ $\textbf{Z}^2$,called the grid point,where i and j multiples of g.
\break


\textit{Grid segment}: A grid segment is the set of points on a grid line between and inclusive of two consecutive grid point.Thus,the horizontal grid segment belonging to ${\textit{l}}_H$(\textit{j}) and lying between two consecutive vertical grid lines, ${\textit{l}}_V$(\textit{i}) and ${\textit{l}}_V$(\textit{i}+\textit{j}),is  \textit{$s_j^{i}$} =\{(\textit{ $\i^{'}$},\textit{j})$\in$ ${\textit{l}}_H$(\textit{j}):\textit{i}$\leq$\textit{$i^{'}$}$\leq$\textit{i}+\textit{g}\}.Similarly,the vertical the vertical grid segment belonging to ${\textit{l}}_V$(\textit{i}) between ${\textit{l}}_H$(\textit{j}) and ${\textit{l}}_V$(\textit{i}+\textit{j}), is \textit{$s_i^{j}$} =\{(\textit{i},\textit{ $\j^{'}$})$\in$ ${\textit{l}}_H$(\textit{j}):\textit{j}$\leq$\textit{$j^{'}$}$\leq$\textit{j}+\textit{g}\}.
\break


\textit{Unit grid block (UGB)}: The horizontal digital line ${\textit{l}}_H$(\textit{j}) divides $\textbf{Z}^2$ into half-planes ,which are given by  \textit{$h_H^{+}$}(\textit{j}):=\{(\textit{ $\i^{'}$},\textit{ $\j^{'}$})$\in$ $\textbf{Z}^2$:\textit{$\j^{'}$}$\geq$\textit{j}\} and  \textit{$h_H^{-}$}(\textit{j}):=\{(\textit{ $\i^{'}$},\textit{ $\j^{'}$})$\in$ $\textbf{Z}^2$:\textit{$\j^{'}$}$\leq$\textit{j}\}.Similarly, ${\textit{l}}_V$(\textit{i}) divides \textbf{$Z^{2}$} into two half-planes, which are \textit{$h_V^{+}$}(\textit{i}):=\{(\textit{ $\i^{'}$},\textit{ $\j^{'}$})$\in$ $\textbf{Z}^2$:\textit{$\i^{'}$}$\geq$\textit{i}\} and  \textit{$h_V^{-}$}(\textit{j}):=\{(\textit{ $\i^{'}$},\textit{ $\j^{'}$})$\in$ $\textbf{Z}^2$:\textit{$\i^{'}$}$\leq$\textit{i}\}. Then the set, given by (\textit{$h_V^{+}$}(\textit{i})$\cap$\textit{$h_V^{-}$}(\textit{i}+\textit{g})$\cap$\textit{$h_H^{+}$}(\textit{j})$\cap$\textit{$h_H^{-}$}(\textit{j}+\textit{g})),is defined as the unit grid block,UGB(\textit{i},\textit{j}).The interior of \textit{$U_{1}$} :=UGB(\textit{i},\textit{j}) is given by \textit{$U_{1}$} \ (\textit{$s_{i}^{j}$}$\cup$\textit{$s_{i+g}^{j}$}$\cup$ \textit{$s_{i}^{j}$}$\cup$\textit{$s_{i+g}^{j}$}). Hence, for a given grid point, qði; jÞ, there are four neighbouring UGBs, namely, \textit{$U_{1}$} :=UGB(\textit{i},\textit{j}),\textit{$U_{2}$} :=UGB(\textit{i-g},\textit{j}),\textit{$U_{3}$} :=UGB(\textit{i-g},\textit{j-g}) and \textit{$U_{4}$} :=UGB(\textit{i-g},\textit{j}).
\break
 

\textit{Isothetic polygon}: An isothetic polygon \textit{P} is a simple polygon of finite size in \textbf{$Z^{2}$} whose alternative sides are subsets of the members of \textbf{H} and \textbf{V}.The polygon \textit{P},hence given by a finite set of UGBs,is represented by the sequence of its vertices,which are grid points.The border \textit{$B_{P}$} of \textit{P} is the set of points belonging to its sides.The interior of \textit{P} is the set of points in the union of its constituting UGBs excluding the border of P.
\break


\textit{Outer isothetic cover}: The outer (isothetic) cover (OIC), denoted by $\bar{P}$(\textit{S}), is a set of outer polygons and (outer) hole polygons, such that the region, given by the union of the outer polygons minus the union of the interiors of the hole polygons, contains a UGB if and only if it has object occupancy (i.e., has a nonempty intersection with S).
\break
